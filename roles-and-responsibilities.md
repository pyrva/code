Assist the Organizer in pursuing the goals and development of PyRVA. Co-organizers have the authority to act on behalf of the Organizer in their absence. They will be listed as a contact for the PSF. Co-Organizers will have full moderation privileges on all PyRVA digital assets.

### Assistant Organizer

- Meetup: Assistant Organizer
- Github: Member

The assistant organizers will assist the Organizer and Co-Organizer(s) in growing PyRVA. Assistant Organizers will have access to all the tools used by the Organizer and Co-Organizers. Elevated privileges on PyRVA's digital assets will be granted on a case by case basis. Assistant Organizers will be able to create and modify events on Meetup. 

### Event Organizer

- Meetup: Event Organizer

Event Organizers will be able to create and modify events on Meetup. This role is intended to allow designated individuals to create social events. Event Organizers will have access to all the tools used by the Organizer and Co-Organizers.

## Change of Role

Any organizer may step down to a lower role at any time.

Any member in good standing may be promoted to Assistant Organizer or Event Organizer by receiving approval from any Organizer or Co-Organizer. This process is started by submitting a request to an Organizer or Co-Organizer.

Elevation to Organizer or Co-Organizer requires being in the Assistant Organizer role for at least six months. The process is started by receiving a nomination from an Organizer or Co-Organizer. Elevation in role is confirmed by receiving a majority approval of the Organizer and Co-Organizer team. Elevation of roles will occur at the monthly organizer meeting.

Organizers are expected to attend meetings regularly. Attendance requirements are as follows:

- Attend a minimum of 50% of meetings (Lecture Night, Coding Night, Organizer Meetings) in a six month span
- Attend Organizer Meetings:
   - Organizer / Co-Organizer: 3 in a six month span
   - Assistant Organizer: 2 in a six month span
   - Event Organizer: 1 in a six month span
- Attend at least one meeting of any type in a two month span

If an organizer's attendance does not fulfill the requirements, they will be moved down one level (Assistant and Event Organizers will be moved to the regular membership level). Reinstatement will occur as defined above.
