# Virtual Event Policy

This policy serves as general guidance around when PyRVA will convert in-person events into virtual events. We will look to the following organizations to determine the safety of in-person events:

* Government Entities
  * Chesterfield County Public Schools
  * Henrico County Public Schools
  * Richmond City Public Schools
* Higher Education
  * University of Richmond
  * Virginia Commonwealth University
* Industry
  * Capital One
  * Markel

If any of these organizations closes due to inclement weather, the Organizers will determine the need for a virtual event.

## COVID-19

To protect the most vulnerable members of our community, we will hold events virtually.

The following criteria shall be met before returning to in-person events:

* All of the organizations listed above must be back to "normal" operations.
* Negative infection rate trends for
  * Chesterfield County
  * Henrico County
  * Richmond City
* Organizers are unanimously for returning to in-person meetings.
