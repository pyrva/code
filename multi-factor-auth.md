# Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication is required for any member on any platform where that member is acting with admin / moderator privleges.
For example, members who have the Owner role on GitHub, or Organizers role on Discord, are required to enable multi-factor authentication enabled on that respective platform.
Members who have lesser privleges, but still have named access on a platform (e.g. Member / Outside Colaborator access on GitHub) are encouraged, but not required, to enable multi-factor authorization.

## Summary of Requirements by Role (as of 1/6/2021)

| Platform | Required Roles | Encouraged Roles |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub | Owner | Member, Outside Collaborator |
